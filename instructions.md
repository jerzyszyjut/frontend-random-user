# Intro

For this task, we will use a free API that allows generating random users: https://randomuser.me/

You can find there the documentation along with available HTTP endpoints and sample responses.

# Functionalities

The goal is to write an application that will communicate with this API and have the following functionalities:

1) Display a button that should generate a new user.
2) Generated user should be displayed on the page. Present: first name, last name, picture, register date, nationality, and location address.
3) Clicking the button again should replace the previous user with the new one.
4) Add checkbox "Hide address". If the field is checked, you shouldn't fetch or display an address for this user.
5) Only fetch the data you need.
6) Create a separate page to display a table with the last 10 generated users. Display first name, last name, country, and registration date.
7) Allow sorting table by last name and registration date.
8) Data in the table should be saved after leaving the page (you can use e.g. localStorage) and set on init.

# Requirements

1) The application should be written in VanillaJS. Do not use any frameworks, we want to test your JS knowledge.
2) Do not use libraries (e.g. Bootstrap) for styling. You can use CSS/SCSS/SASS.
3) We do not expect the app to look outstanding, but we want to see your styling skills.
4) The application should be responsive to all resolutions.
5) Tests are much appreciated, but not necessary.
6) You can use TypeScript, but it is not required
7) It is allowed to use NodeJS and NPM for setting up local hosting and/or compiling SASS/SCSS files.
8) Please put your solution in a private repository on Github and invite reviewer@profil-software.com as a collaborator (any role with at least read-only access to code) -> https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository
